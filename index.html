      <h3>Cheunghao Tu</h3>
      <p>
	  I started programming since 2019. I like to create and program robots using Arduino and RaspberryPi.
	  My hobbies are playing retro games, speedcubing and playing music (piano, flute, violin, etc).
	  I can program in python, Java and C; my most proficient language is Java where I can program software for Android devices.
	  My skill with html/css/javascript is beginner at best.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Bouncing Balls</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City(2021). 
	This Processing project demonstrates the use of ArrayLists, nested loops, mouse & key presses and randomness.
	When the mouse is clicked, a ball of random colour is created at the cursor's position, shooting off in a random direction.
	Each of these balls are stored in an ArrayList. When a ball of equal size and colour touch, they will combine.

    <h3>Final Project 2022: 2D Game</h3>
    <p>
	This is my game, called Crab Dungeon, a dungeon crawler made for the Java Module at City. 
	It was programmed in IntelliJ Idea as the IDE and demonstrates a large amount of programming techniques. 
	The game runs by extending Canvas and Runnable.
	The player can move via the WASD keys in all 8 directions using the KeyAdapter class and shoot projectiles with the mouse using the MouseAdapter class. 
	All the images are using sprite sheets which are rendered using the Graphics and Graphics2D classes. 
	The game currently has 3 levels but can easily be expanded as the level generation is handled using a png.
